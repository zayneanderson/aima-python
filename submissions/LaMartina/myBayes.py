Build the target list,
one entry for each row in the input frame.

The Naive Bayesian network is a classifier,
i.e. it sorts data points into bins.
The best it can do to estimate a continuous variable
is to break the domain into segments, and predict
the segment into which the variable's value will fall.
In this example, I'm breaking Trump's % into two
arbitrary segments.
